# Wordle_Java
Wordle is a game that give players six chances to guess a random 5 selected letter word. 

I was given a MyArrayList class where I needed to add two methods (checkChar() and checkWin()) and a skeleton test program where I needed to make the game work. 

With the method checkChar() it will receive a 5 letter word and return an array list with the characters of your own choosing. For example:
A: valid character + correct position
B: valid character + incorrect position
C: invalid character

With the method checkWin() returns true if all the characters in the array are valid and in their correct positions.
